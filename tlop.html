<p class="yeezustext "> The seventh studio album by American producer and rapper Kanye West is titled The Life of Pablo. Def Jam Recordings handled distribution, and GOOD Music released it on February 14, 2016. From 2013 to 2016, recording sessions were held in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the US. Production was handled by West and other producers, including co-executive producers Rick Rubin and Noah Goldstein. Kelly Price, Chance the Rapper, Kirk Franklin, Kid Cudi, Desiigner, Rihanna, Young Thug, Chris Brown, The Weeknd, Vic Mensa, Sia, Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, and Sampha were among the guest vocalists that West invited to contribute to the album.</p>

<p class="yeezustext" > The Life of Pablo was nominated for five Grammy Awards in 2017, including Best Rap Album. However, many newspapers felt that the album's denial for Album of the Year was a snub. The album became the first to reach the top solely through streaming when it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after Tidal first revealed its streaming data and made it available to rival streaming services. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) eventually certified the album double platinum. Along with its top ten debuts in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden, it also made its debut at number one in Norway.</p>
