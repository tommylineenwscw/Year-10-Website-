<p class="yeezustext"> The tenth studio album by American rapper Kanye West, titled "Donda," was distributed by Def Jam Recordings and released through GOOD Music on August 29, 2021. It is West's last release with the label. The Weeknd, Jay-Z, Marilyn Manson, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott, Lil Yachty, Baby Keem, Playboi Carti, Jay Electronica, Lil Baby, DaBaby, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla Sign, Fivio Foreign, Lil Durk, Pop Smoke, and Young Thug are just a few of the artists who have made guest appearances on the album. Chris Brown's vocals were also included on the album before it was updated. On November 14, 2021, a deluxe edition with guest vocals by Andr√© 3000, Tyler, the Creator, and KayCyy was released. </p>

<p class="yeezustext"> Donda was heavily influenced by religion; a large portion of the content revolves around West's religious beliefs. The album's lyrical material has been characterized by some critics as being darker and more somber than West's prior works.According to Riley Wallace, Exclaim! is a "more accessible body of work" and far less awkward than Jesus Is King. Addiction and mental instability are frequently discussed, along with Kanye West's ego and family, including the breakdown of his marriage to Kim Kardashian and ideas about Donda. Additionally, there are themes of salvation, regeneration, and hope.
