<p class="mbdtext"> Kanye West, an American rapper and producer, released his fifth studio album titled My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. On November 22, 2010, Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records released it. After a period of controversy in 2009 with his interruption of Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), he withdrew to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii. The album was recorded at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a collaborative setting with other artists. Further recordings were recorded at the New York City studios Electric Lady and Platinum Sound, as well as Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California. </p>
