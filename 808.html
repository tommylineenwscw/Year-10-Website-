<p class="hrt4"> 808s & Heartbreak is the fourth studio album by the American rapper Kanye West. It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 24, 2008, having been recorded earlier that year in September and October at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dominating its production, West was assisted by fellow producers No I.D., Plain Pat, Jeff Bhasker, and Mr Hudson, while also utilizing guest vocalists for some tracks, including Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, and Lil Wayne. </p>
<p class= "hrt4"> This album was produced after Kanye's mother, Donda West passed away in 2007 and his split from then-fiance Alexis Phifer, represented a significant artistic shift from his earlier rap albums. Instead, West used an Auto-Tune processor to manipulate his vocals while singing over an electronic production and a minimalist sonic palette that heavily featured the Roland TR-808 drum machine and minor keys. Inspired by the painful personal circumstances and his problems with pop popularity, Kanye's lyrics on the album explore themes of heartbreak, alienated fame, and loss.</p>
