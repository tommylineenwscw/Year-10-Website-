    <p class="yeezustext"> Ye is American rapper Kanye West's eighth studio album. June 1, 2018, saw its release via GOOD Music, with distribution handled by Def Jam Recordings. After a TMZ interview sparked controversy, Kanye West rerecorded every song on the album, finishing it in just two weeks at West Lake Ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. PartyNextDoor, Ty Dolla Sign, Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, Jeremih, and 070 Shake are among the artists who contribute guest vocals to the song.</p>

<p class="yeezustext"> Ye provides an insight into West's mind, concentrating on the artist's persona. The rapper's mental state is discussed throughout the album, much of which depicts him losing his mind. "Ghost Town" is especially connected to this idea. Ye seems more uneasy in compared to The Life of Pablo's exploration of the less glamorous aspects of fame and family in this theme. The album touches with West's bipolar disorder and suicide ideas in relation to the mental health issue. Elijah Matos of Rapzilla magazine claims that the album is one of the few major instances of hip hop that explores mental health in a way akin to the more recent waves of Christian rap and current emo.</p>
