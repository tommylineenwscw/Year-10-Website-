<p class="yeezustext"> The sixth studio album by American producer and rapper Kanye West is titled Yeezus. On June 18, 2013, Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records released it. For the production, West brought together a variety of musicians and close allies, such as Travis Scott, Mike Dean, Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, and Hudson Mohawke. In addition, Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank Ocean contribute guest vocals to the album. 

 .Producer Rick Rubin was brought in by West fifteen days prior to Yeezus's release date to assist with simplifying the album's sound. Some have described the album as West's most sonically aggressive and experimental effort to date. It incorporates elements of punk, electro, Chicago drill, industrial, acid house, and other genres. One example of West's unorthodox sample usage is "Blood on the Leaves," which features a clip from Nina Simone's 1965 performance of "Strange Fruit."
